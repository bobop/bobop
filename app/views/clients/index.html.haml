    %p My clients have ranged from VC funded music industry startups to Insurance Premium Tax companies. Unfortunately I'm not able to list some of these clients because I worked for them through other agencies. Do contact me if you want to know about them.
    %p Here are some of my latest clients:
    %p= link_to 'New Client', new_client_path if current_user
    - @clients.each do |client|
      .row
        .span12.content
          .f_right
            = image_tag client.logo.url(:medium)
          %h2= client.name
          %h3= link_to client.website, client.website
          %p= link_to "More Details Â»", client_path(client), :class => "btn"
          %p= link_to 'Edit', edit_client_path(client) if current_user
          %p= link_to 'Destroy', client, :confirm => 'Are you sure?', :method => :delete if current_user
